            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- Add superscript, emphasis, abbreviation -->
            <p>My name is Vivian and I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year student at Algonquin College. I am currently taking the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of how modern technology & user interfaces are used and created. I spend most of my free time online, playing video games or just browsing & consuming content on apps like YouTube, X, Netflix, Snapchat, etc.. I would like to get out of the house more, but recently I have not been able to find the time to do anything productive because of my busy schedule. I work at a sports memorabilia store in the St. Laurent Shopping Center, & I am at school almost every day of the week. Tuesday is the only day where I have nothing happening. I never work on Tuesday, and since there is no school I usually never have any plans, and can take a day off to catch up on coursework or just spend some time alone. I am a quiet person, and I enjoy my own company.</p>

            <p>Something I am very interested in is <em>K-Pop</em>. I am a big fan of this genre of music and the content put out by different groups that I follow. I also enjoy various different sports/outdoor activities, such as skiing, swimming, hiking, & soccer, however I have not played soccer in a while because last time I played I ended up dislocating my knee. Another interest of mine is watching Anime. Hunter X Hunter, Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan, & Code Geass are a few of my favourites. I am not sure what I'd like to do after graduating, but I'm hoping this course will give me some new ideas & opportunites, and maybe I will have some sort of idea of what I'd like to do once I have more knowledge and experience.</p>
